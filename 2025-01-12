- Updated the kivy-buildozer-docker automator - it actually works ... I think, haven't finished fully testing it :S

- Ran the build_1.apk, it ran for 15 secs before crashing. I'm not disheartened because I have solutions for the over the top package.

- Finding motivation lacking today, coined some new ideas for a game.
