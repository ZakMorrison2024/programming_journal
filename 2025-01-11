- Man Why is it so hard, surely this was made to streamline, like I pulled and it didn't work, I've written my own custom and after 4 days I'm still trying
all I want is too see how ineffecient my app is on a weaker android phone ¬¬ (obviously I did other things in those 4 days ¬¬)

- coined the idea that I should set my ringtone to FF6 battle theme and have tasker/termnix play FF6 Victory Fanfare after every call

- I found this on a python discord - https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#interactive-api-docs-upgrade

- Got GPT to write a GUI (KIVY) app that automates buildozer and dockerfiles, it's not finished but yeah, something to work on later


- This would be good to revise and make good practice for future projects:

        tip_percentage: float,
